# Five-Servo
##  I connect **five servo motors** to the Arduino UNO board, where I will connect the **GND** of the **motor** to the **GND**of the **Arduino**, and the power to the **5V** of the Arduino, and the signal pin I connect it to the analog pin of the Arduino, then I **put a variable resistance** on the board. I connect its pins according to the voltage, and the signal's pin I connect to the analog input of the Arduino board A0.
## Since I compress the primitive values ​​of **all inputs and outputs to zero**.
## Then I link the rotation of the motors according to the value of the variable resistance through the command map where it follows the variable resistance variable **res**, and the range of motion for each of them is **from 0-90 degrees**.
